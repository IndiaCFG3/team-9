JPMC CODE FOR GOOD-2020
Teacher's Desk

Our web-app is a one-stop portal for all their problems. We have tried to integrate all the link in a scheduler and tried integrating the Twilio API for sending SMS and WhatsApp messages from the Web App directly to the students. We also tried to create a call scheduler, where the teachers can put their preferred time slots and the students can schedule a one on one call, with the teacher.
